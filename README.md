# JS User Group Ramp Up

## Goals
To provide a collaborative ramp up opportunity for the community that might not know where to start and to cover introductory topics that might not otherwise be covered by the normal presentation format of the group.

## Format
- Setup 8-10 tables of 6 chairs each
- As people arrive, determine which topic / role they are there for
  - if they are first, allocate a table to that topic
  - point them to the appropriate table
  - Once at least 2 people are at a table, they should pair and start
- Mentors
	- Learn each others names
	- Familiarize with the goals of the topic and the level of the members of the group
	- Encourage people to split into pairs
	- Introduce the first exercise and help people transition to coding
