# New to JavaScript

##Goals: 
- Introduce JavaScript
	- if
	- flow control
	- functions
	- variable
	- strings
	- falsy
	- pass by reference or value

**Assumes:** you have programmed in other languages and know [programming concepts](new-to-programming.md), just not the semantics of JavaScript. 

## Fundamentals

Here is a good [link](http://www.codecademy.com/glossary/javascript) summarizing javascript concepts. 

## Exercises: 

And a number of good exercises [here](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/javascript). 

Finished with those, want one last challenge? 

Implement a **simple** hashing algorithm, where given any input you get a unique result. Start with a boolean, then a string, then an object. The point isn't to produce a perfect hashing algorithm but instead to leverage the javascript fundamentals you've learned today.
